# C Microgames

A collection of small console games, written in C.

The idea is to implement a series of small games in C, with increasing complexity and review/update my knowledge on the language itself.
Some of the games are very basic in concept, but I will try to make a little twist in each one of them, to keep things interesting.

So far, there's nothing to show, except the project structure.

## Why?

Because I feel the need to brush of my old C skills. Also, it's a good opportunity to learn [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).
The point here is to review (relearn?) C and play some simple games.
